This program was made after solving the follwing kata from codewars.com:
https://www.codewars.com/kata/525c7c5ab6aecef16e0001a5
I have written the solution in JavaScript and created an executable package for windows using npm and node.
You can find the JavaScript code for this program in the source folder along with other dependencies.
